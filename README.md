Project stucture

 include: head files
 fws:     FLUID GUI development workspace
 prg:     test source codes  programs
 src:     source files
 gui:     FLTK GUI interface (automatically generated by FLUID)
 obj:     temporal object files

Compilation instructions

 Copy the compress file wherever you want to compile and untar it
 
 > $ tar -xvzf fl_anna.tar.gz
 
 > $ cd fl_anna
 
 > $ make
 
 you will find a test programs in the "bin" directory just type
 
 > ./bpanna
 
 for no GUI interface or,
 
 > ./fl_bpann
 
 for a FLTK GUI application

DOCUMENTATION:

 read_data_file(file);          load a data file
 
 set_output(no);                Set number of outputs (no)
 
 set_input(ni);                 Set number of inputs (ni)
 
 set_layers(nl);                Set number of layers (nl)
 
 create();                      create the neural network framework
 
 set_neurons_in_layer(l,n);     Set number (n) of neurons of the layer (l)
 
 select_training_algorithm(b);  true = Levenverg-Maquardt (LM),
                                false = Conjugate gradient (CG)
 initialize();                  initialize the neural network weights
 
 set_alpha(alpha);              this is the CG learning rate
 
 set_mu(mu);                    this is the LM perturbation factor
 
 training();                    one step training
 
 evalue();                      evalue the net and give the result in a vector

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 The  Artificial Neural Network Architecture  (ANNA)   is  a
 Back propagation neural network  class  easy  to  use  with
 the FLTK library.  So you will need to have FLTK-1.3 installed.

 You can get FLTK from www.fltk.org

 The ANNA class library is compose by the following files:

 anna_bpn_net.h anna_bpn_layer.h anna_bpn_neuron.h
 anna_bpn_net.cxx anna_bpn_layer.cxx anna_bpn_neuron.cxx

 The distribution include a demo which should work on Linux systems.
 
 If you want a binary, but only if you really cannot compile it. I can help you to compile it anyway. Send me an email.


 So enjoy it!
